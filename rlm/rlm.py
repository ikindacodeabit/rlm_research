"""Recursive Language Model (RLM) with a configurable MEMORY BUDGET (eviction-only)
and an optional persistent SCRATCHPAD.

This is a drop-in successor to the minimal scaffold. The paradigm is unchanged
(Zhang, Kraska & Khattab, 2025): the long prompt is NOT placed in the model's
context window; it lives as a string `context` in a persistent REPL, and the
root LM writes code to inspect it / recurse via `llm_query`.

MemoryBudget caps the ROOT model's context window (in tokens), independent of
document length. The full transcript is kept server-side, but the root only ever
SEES a bounded view: system + begin + the most-recent turns that fit the budget.
Older turns are simply DROPPED (evicted). Because REPL variables persist across
turns, the model can always recompute or re-fetch anything an evicted turn
produced.

Scratchpad (opt-in, orthogonal to the budget) gives the root a `note(text)` REPL
tool. Saved notes are re-injected into the root's view on EVERY turn — with or
without a budget — so, unlike raw REPL output, they never scroll out. (An earlier
scratchpad was removed because its notes were only re-injected under a budget,
making it a no-op in unbounded runs; this version injects unconditionally.)
Under a budget, notes survive eviction, giving the model a durable place for
evidence beyond persistent variables. Default is OFF: with `scratchpad=None`
behavior is exactly the eviction-only scaffold above.

Grounding note: the anti-hallucination guard (FINAL literal must appear in real
output) checks a SEPARATE server-side `seen_output` accumulator, which is never
compacted. So shrinking the budget never weakens grounding.

NOTE: model-generated code is executed with `exec`. On a shared cluster, run this
inside your own user account / a SLURM job only. For stricter isolation, wrap the
REPL in a separate process or container.

ROOT_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are solving a task over a LONG document that does NOT fit in your context window.
The document is stored in a Python REPL as a string variable named `context`
(length: {ctx_len} characters). You interact with it by writing Python code.

RULES:
- Reply with exactly ONE Python code block, fenced as ```python ... ```, and then
  STOP. Write NOTHING after the code block.
- CRITICAL: You CANNOT see the result of your code until the next message. NEVER
  write, guess, or simulate the REPL output yourself. NEVER state an answer you
  have not literally seen in a real REPL output message.
- The REPL is persistent: variables survive across turns. Like Python's
  interactive shell, the value of a bare final expression is echoed back to you.
- Useful tools available in the REPL:
    * `context` (str): the full document.
    * `llm_query(prompt: str) -> str`: ask a sub-LLM about text. IMPORTANT: the
      sub-LLM CANNOT see `context` or any of your variables — it sees ONLY the
      prompt string you pass. You MUST embed the actual text snippet inside the
      prompt, e.g. llm_query("Answer X based on this text:\\n" + context[i:j])
      (each call's prompt is truncated at {sub_char_cap} characters, so pass a
      focused snippet, not the whole document). Capture the result:
      ans = llm_query(...) then print(ans).{note_tool}
    * `print(...)`: anything you print is shown back to you in the NEXT message
      (truncated to {obs_limit} chars), so print only what you need to see.
- Strategy: peek at structure first (e.g. `print(context[:2000])`,
  `print(len(context))`, regex search), then narrow down with string ops or
  chunked `llm_query` calls. Do NOT print the whole context.
- If a search or extraction returns ZERO matches or fewer than the task implies,
  that is a signal your pattern is wrong — NOT that the answer is 0 or empty.
    Print a sample of the text around a likely keyword to see the actual format,
      then retry with a corrected pattern.
      - When the task states how many items exist, verify your extraction found that
        many before computing the final answer.
- Once (and only once) you have SEEN the information needed for the answer in a
  real REPL output, finish with a code block calling FINAL(...) on a VARIABLE or
  expression computed by your code. NEVER call FINAL with a literal guessed
  value — FINAL("42") with a made-up constant will be rejected.
- You have at most {max_steps} code turns. Be efficient.{budget_note}

Example of a correct session (3 turns):
  You:  ```python
        idx = context.find("invoice total")
        print(context[max(0, idx-200):idx+500])
        ```
  REPL: ...The invoice total for March was $4,210 including tax...
  You:  ```python
        ans = llm_query("What was the March invoice total? Answer from this text:\\n" + context[idx-200:idx+500])
        print(ans)
        ```
  REPL: $4,210
  You:  ```python
        FINAL(ans)
        ```
