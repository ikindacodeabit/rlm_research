# RLM Long-Context Benchmarking on Prajna (via NVIDIA NIM)

## Goal
Quantify how Recursive Language Models (RLMs) compare against vanilla long-context
inference on standard long-context benchmarks, using NVIDIA NIM hosted APIs as the
inference backend and Prajna for orchestration, data prep, and scoring.

## Architecture decision
**Phase 1 (this repo): NIM cloud API.** All model calls go to
`https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1` (OpenAI-compatible). Prajna runs the RLM
scaffold (REPL loop, recursion, scoring) — no GPU needed for this phase, so submit
to a CPU-friendly partition and save your GPU quota.

**Phase 2 (later): self-hosted inference on Prajna GPUs.** Once the harness works,
swap `base_url` to a local vLLM/SGLang server running on the DGX A100 / L40S nodes
(e.g. Qwen3-8B to reproduce the paper's RLM-Qwen3-8B setting). The code is backend
agnostic — only the config changes.

## Pipeline
```
[login node]                          [compute node, CPU partition]
download datasets (HF) ──> /scratch ──> SLURM array job: run_benchmark.py
                                          ├── condition A: vanilla (full context in prompt)
                                          ├── condition B: RLM (context as REPL variable)
                                          └── per-example JSONL results + resumable checkpoints
                                       ──> score.py ──> results table
```

## Steps
1. **Account/API setup**
   - Get an NVIDIA API key at build.nvidia.com (starts with `nvapi-`).
   - On Prajna: `echo 'export NVIDIA_API_KEY=nvapi-...' >> ~/.bashrc` (never hardcode in scripts).
2. **Environment** (login node is fine for this — it's just pip):
   - `python -m venv ~/venvs/rlm && source ~/venvs/rlm/bin/activate`
   - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Connectivity check** — HPC compute nodes often have no outbound internet.
   Run `sbatch slurm/check_net.slurm`. If it fails, ask hpc@iitb.ac.in about an
   HTTP proxy for compute nodes, or run the harness on the login node ONLY for
   tiny smoke tests (API orchestration is light, but per Prajna policy real runs
   must not live on login nodes).
4. **Data prep** (login node, since it needs internet):
   - `bash slurm/download_data.sh` — pulls benchmark datasets to `/scratch/<you>/rlm_data`
   - Synthetic NIAH/RULER-style tasks are generated locally (no download needed).
5. **Smoke test** (~5 examples): `python benchmarks/run_benchmark.py --task niah --limit 5 --mode both`
6. **Full runs**: `sbatch slurm/run_eval.slurm` (job array over task × mode).
7. **Score & compare**: `python benchmarks/score.py results/`

## Benchmarks (in order of effort)
| Benchmark | Why | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Synthetic NIAH / RULER-style | Sanity check; both vanilla & RLM should ace it | generated locally |
| LongBench v2 | Standard, broad long-context QA | HF: `THUDM/LongBench-v2` |
| OOLONG | The benchmark where the RLM paper showed the biggest gap | HF (see download script) |
| ∞Bench / BrowseComp-Plus | 100k–10M token stress tests (RLM-only territory) | HF |

## Experimental conditions
- **Vanilla**: full context stuffed into the prompt of a long-context NIM model
  (truncate at model limit; record truncation).
- **RLM**: same base model as the REPL "root", context held as a Python variable,
  `llm_query()` available for recursive sub-calls (depth 1 to start).
- Hold the base model constant across both conditions. Suggested starters from the
  NIM catalog: a large-context model for the vanilla ceiling and a cheaper small
  model to replicate the paper's "small RLM beats big vanilla" claim.

## Metrics
- Accuracy / F1 per task (exact-match for NIAH, substring/F1 for QA)
- Tokens used per query (prompt + completion, summed over all recursive calls)
- Wall-clock latency per query
- REPL steps used; failure modes (max-steps exhausted, code errors, API errors)

## Practical constraints to engineer around
- NIM free tier: ~40 req/min and limited credits → built-in rate limiter,
  exponential backoff, and JSONL checkpointing (resume with the same command).
- Vanilla condition burns credits fast at 100k+ tokens; start with `--limit 50`.
- Set `--time` in SLURM generously: RLM runs are many sequential API calls.
